"Confirm dialog box"

Like alert, it’s a method that accepts one optional parameter – a message that will be displayed. The difference between alert and confirm is that the confirm dialog 
box displays two buttons, the OK button and the Cancel button. Depending on the button pressed by the user, the confirm method returns a Boolean value. True is returned 
when the user closes the dialog box using the OK button, and false is returned when the user presses the Cancel button.

The values true or false, returned by the confirm method as a result of the user's decision, allow for conditional execution of some program actions. In the example 
below, we have additionally used a recently learned conditional operator:
 -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body> 
        <script>
            let decision = window.confirm("Is it OK?");
            console.log(decision);

            let remove = confirm("Remove all data?");
            let message = remove ? "Deleting Data" : "Cancelled"
            console.log(message);
        </script>     
    </body>
</html>
