<!-- Prompt dialog box -->
<!----------------------->

<!-- 
Itâ€™s a further development of the confirm popup. Like the confirm dialog box, it contains the OK and Cancel buttons, but it also contains a single-line text field 
that allows the user to input text.

As with other dialog boxes, the prompt accepts an optional parameter as a message that will be displayed. The prompt also accepts a second optional parameter, which 
is the default value of the text field visible in the dialog window. The same as confirm, the prompt method will return a result that is dependent on user input.

If the user closes the window with the OK button, anything in the text field will be returned from the prompt method as a string. If the dialog box is closed with the 
Cancel button, the method will return a null value. Due to the fact that on pressing the OK button, the value returned will be of the String type, we sometimes need 
to convert it to another type, for example, to a Number type. As with all user input, we need to be prepared for the fact that the data provided by the user can be 
invalid, either by mistake or on purpose, so always treat values like this with extra caution.
