DIALOG BOXES

Dialog boxes are integral parts of web browsers, and available in almost all of them, even really old ones. All of them are popup windows (or modal windows) which 
means that when the dialog box is displayed, it isn’t possible to interact with the webpage itself until this dialog box is closed. This inconvenience when the popup 
is visible is one of the reasons why we shouldn’t overuse them. They’re perfectly fine for the learning process, and in some rare cases where important information 
needs to be displayed, or some input from the user is mandatory, but they should be avoided in other circumstances. We have three dialog boxes available to use.

ALERT DIALOG BOX

The alert dialog box is the simplest one of the three, and to show an alert box, we need to call a method named alert(). The alert method accepts one optional 
parameter – the text that will be displayed. The alert method is a method of the object window, but for convenience, it can be used without the need to type 
window.alert, so both forms are correct and can be seen in real applications. The window object is a generalization of the browser window or tab, and gives the 
developer access to data related to the state of this window (for example, how far the page is scrolled down, because the console object is part of the window object) 
and also some methods to control this state.

Just like console.log, we can insert any value to the alert method and it will be converted to a string. The difference is that we can put an arbitrary number of 
parameters to console.log, whereas with the alert we must put only one (or zero, as it’s an optional parameter).

The alert window will be visible until the user clicks the OK button visible on the popup. Code execution will be halted until the dialog box is closed.
