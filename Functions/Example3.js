// Functions - Local variables //

/*
we call the variables that are declared and used in some limited scope and are not visible in the whole program, which means that we can only use them inside that 
particular scope. Variables declared with the let keyword are local inside the code block (i.e. inside the range limited by curly brackets), while variables declared 
with the var keyword are local inside the function block. So if we declare a variable inside a function block, whether using let or var, it will only be visible (and 
usable) inside the function block. This is very useful, because usually the variables we use inside a function are not needed outside of it.
*/

/*
In our code, an example of such a variable is sum. We only refer to it inside the function. A global declaration is therefore unnecessary. The sum variable is now local,
it can only be used inside the getMeanTemp function (which is enough for us, because it was not needed for anything outside the function). In general, we should strive 
to keep the function code as separate from the surrounding context as possible, among other things by not using global variables inside it. In our example, there are 
two more such variables: temperatures and meanTemp. The latter, meanTemp, is used inside the function to store and return the calculated result.
