// Functions as first-class members //
//////////////////////////////////////

/*
In JavaScript, functions are first-class members. This term means that functions can be treated as any data, which can be stored in variables or passed as arguments to 
other functions. For example, we can declare the showMessage function and then store it in the variable sm.
*/

function showMessage(message) {
    console.log(`Message: ${message}`);
}

let sm = showMessage;

/*
We can store any function that is accessible in this scope in a variable and use a function call operator () to execute it. We can check that the sm variable is now a 
function by using the typeof operator.
*/
sm("This works!"); // -> Message: This works!
console.log(typeof sm); // -> function

/*
But itâ€™s important to remember that when assigning a function to a variable, we don't use a function call operator, as this would execute the function and assign the 
result of the function to a variable, and not to the function itself.

In the example, the result of the doNothing function call (i.e. the undefined value returned by the function) is stored in the a variable, while the doNothing function 
itself is stored in the b variable (or more precisely, a reference to the function is stored in the b variable). This property is especially useful when passing the 
function as a call parameter to other function.
*/
function doNothing() {
    return undefined;
}

let a = doNothing(); // Assign result of function call
let b = doNothing;   // Assign a function

console.log(typeof a); // -> undefined
console.log(typeof b); // -> function

/*
The operation function takes as its first argument the function (parameter func) and calls it with the other two arguments passed (parameters first and second).
*/
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}

function operation(func, first, second) {
    return func(first, second);
}

console.log(operation(add, 10, 20)); // -> 30
console.log(operation(multiply, 10, 20)); // -> 200
