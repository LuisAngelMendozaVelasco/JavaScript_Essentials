/*
It means that we can declare a global variable and a local variable of the same name. 

In the local scope, in which we declare a local variable using its name, we will have access to the local value (the global variable is hidden behind the local one, 
so we do not have access to it in this local scope). Using this name outside the local scope means that we will be referring to the global variable. 
This is not best programming practice, however, and we should avoid such situations. It is not difficult to guess that with a bit of inattention, using this 
mechanism can lead to unintended situations and probably to errors in the operation of the program.
*/

/*
An example without shadowing. The counter variable, declared at the beginning of the program, is a global variable. Throughout the program, also inside the block, 
we operate on this very variable.
*/
let counter = 100;

console.log(counter); // -> 100

{
   counter = 200;
   console.log(counter); // -> 200
}

console.log(counter); // -> 200

/*
This time in the block, instead of counter = 200; (i.e. changes in the contents of the global counter variable), the let counter = 200; statement appears 
(i.e. declarations of the local variable combined with its initialization). The interpreter would consider such a situation to be wrong if the re-declaration 
appeared in the same scope.
However, the declaration is local (itâ€™s a different scope than global) and all references to the variable with this name inside the block will refer to this local 
variable. Outside the block, the global variable will still be seen under the same name. 
*/
let counter = 100;

console.log(counter); // -> 100

{
  let counter = 200;
  console.log(counter); // -> 200
}

console.log(counter); // -> 100

/*
Shadowing may not only be concerned with the situation in which a local variable covers a global variable. If nested scopes appear (e.g. nested blocks in the case 
of a let declaration), the local variable declared in a more nested block will overshadow the local variable of the same name declared in the external block.

Shadowing is also present in variable declarations using the word var, and this time the local scope is limited not by the program block, but by the function block.

In most cases, this is not desirable, so try to avoid giving the same variable names to multiple variables, regardless of where you declare them.
