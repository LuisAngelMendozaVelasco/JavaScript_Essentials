<!-- The break keyword -->
<!----------------------->

<!--
In contrast to if statements, switch statements do not execute just one branch, but rather they execute the entire code from the first case that matches until the end 
of the switch statement. This behavior is called pass-through and has some uses, but most of the time we want to execute only one branch, and for that reason the break 
keyword is present. When a JavaScript interpreter comes to a break, it will jump out of the current switch statement.

To understand this better, look at this slightly modified example of a switch statement:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body> 
        <script>
            let gate = prompt("Choose gate: a, b, or c");
            let win = false;

            switch (gate) {
                case "a":
                    alert("Gate A: empty");
                case "b":
                    alert("Gate B: main prize");
                    win = true;
                case "c":
                    alert("Gate C: empty");
                default:
                    alert("No gate " + String(gate));
            }

            if (win) {
                alert("Winner!");
            }
        </script>     
    </body>
</html>

<!-- The only difference is that now there are no break keywords at all. Now all alerts are displayed, even the default one. -->
