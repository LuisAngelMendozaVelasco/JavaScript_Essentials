<!-- The switch … case statement -->
<!--------------------------------->

<!--
The last type of statement that is used for conditional code execution is a switch statement. Compared to the if statement, it is not a construction used especially 
often. It’s somewhat similar to nested if … else statements, but instead of evaluating different expressions, switch evaluates one conditional expression and then 
tries to match its value to one of the given cases.

It starts with the switch keyword followed by the expression to be evaluated in parentheses. Next is the code block that has one or more case clauses (technically it’s 
possible to have zero cases, but this wouldn’t be very useful) followed directly by a value corresponding to this case and a colon character. After the colon, there is 
a block of code that will be executed when the expression is evaluated to this case value. The block of code optionally ends with the break keyword. All cases follow 
the same template.

Additionally, a special case named default can be present (by convention placed on the end of the switch statement; however, it isn’t required). The default case is 
executed when none of the cases matches the expression. The evaluation itself is made with a strict comparison operator (===) so not only must the value match, but 
also the type of case value and the expression.
