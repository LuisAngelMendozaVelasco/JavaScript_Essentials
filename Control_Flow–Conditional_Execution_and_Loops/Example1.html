<!-- Conditional execution -->
<!--------------------------->

<!--
Control flow statements are essential not only to JavaScript, but to programming in general. Without the ability to react and change its behavior, any code would 
always do the same thing. Of course, this is sometimes exactly what we need, but most of the time we need responsiveness and the ability to handle different situations 
in the code.

We can imagine our program as a tree that starts from the trunk and gradually splits it into subsequent branches. The trunk is the beginning of the program, and each 
conditional instruction is a reflection of a new branch. Conditional instructions are executed on the basis of the user's decision, results of previous calculations, 
or other information that the program will take into account. JavaScript provides a few ways to branch code execution, based on arbitrary conditions.

<!-- 
THE IF STATEMENT

The if statement is the first and simplest control flow instruction available in JavaScript. It has a few forms, but in its basic form, it checks a given condition, 
and depending on its Boolean value, either executes a block of code, or skips it. The syntax looks like this:
    if (condition) {
        block of code
    }

The if keyword needs to be followed by the expression in parentheses, which will be evaluated to the Boolean, and if the result is true, the block of code that follows 
the conditional expression is executed. If the expression evaluates to false, the block of code will NOT be executed. The code block should be separated using curly 
brackets.

In the example, an alert with the message "User ready!" will show only when the user closes the confirm dialog box by clicking the OK button. But if the user 
closes the "Are you ready?" confirmation box without clicking OK, the "User ready!" message will never be shown.
