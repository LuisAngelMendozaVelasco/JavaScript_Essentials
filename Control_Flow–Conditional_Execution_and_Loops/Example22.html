The last important part is that if a more complex code is needed inside any given case, we should place that code in separate code blocks by additionally surrounding 
the code with curly brackets. This will add to code readability and allow for the declaration of variables only in the given case scope.

In the example, a redeclaration error would be observed in each of the cases and would not be encapsulated in its own scope.
