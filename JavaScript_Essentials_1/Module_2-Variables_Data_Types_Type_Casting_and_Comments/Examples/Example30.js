// What can arrays be useful for in practice? //
////////////////////////////////////////////////

/*
They are primarily a convenient way to store a collection of elements under one name. Additionally, it is very important that we can add new elements to an array 
while the program is running.

Using an array, we can add new users while the program is running. We mentioned several times that the array elements can be any data, including objects.

let user1 = {   name: "Calvin",
                surname: "Hart",
                age: 66,
                email: "CalvinMHart@teleworm.us"};

let user2 = {   name: "Mateus",
                surname: "Pinto",
                age: 21,
                email: "MateusPinto@dayrep.com"};

// Let's put information about these two users into the users array and try to display some information as part of the test:
let users =[{   name: "Calvin",
                surname: "Hart",
                age: 66,
                email: "CalvinMHart@teleworm.us"},

            {   name: "Mateus",
                surname: "Pinto",
                age: 21,
                email: "MateusPinto@dayrep.com"}];

console.log(users[0].name); // -> Calvin
console.log(users[1].age); // -> 21

// Let's try to add a new user to the array. We will do it  by assigning a new element to a free index.
users[2] = {name: "Irene",
            surname: "Purnell",
            age: 32,
            email: "IreneHPurnell@rhyta.com"}

console.log(users[0].name); // -> Calvin
console.log(users[1].name); // -> Mateus
console.log(users[2].name); // -> Irene

/*
During the program's operation, it is possible to interact with the user, for example, to retrieve data the user has entered. Such data could be used to create 
more objects and extend the array with elements we did not know about while writing the program.
*/

// Apply the typeof operator to the variable containing the array.
let days1 = ["Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"];
console.log(typeof days1); // -> object

/*
To speak quite generally, in JavaScript, everything except primitives is an object. Arrays are also treated as a special kind of object. The typeof operator does 
not distinguish between object types (or more precisely, classes), so it informs us that the days variable contains an object. If we would like to make sure that 
the variable contains an array, we can do it using the instanceof operator, among others. It is closely related to object-oriented programming.

The instanceof operator is a two-argument operator, which requires the tested variable (or literal) and object class to be specified. In our case, the class is Array. 
The operator returns true or false, depending on the test result.
*/
let days2 = ["Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"];
let day = "Sunday";

console.log(typeof days2); // -> object
console.log(typeof day); // -> string

console.log(days2 instanceof Array); // -> true
console.log(day instanceof Array); // -> false

/*
It turns out that an array is implemented as an object in JavaScript, so it probably also has its methods and properties. There are many very useful methods that 
help us to work with arrays, such as combining arrays, cutting out elements, sorting, or filtering.
