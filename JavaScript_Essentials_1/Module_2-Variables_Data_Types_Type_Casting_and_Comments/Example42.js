/*
Multi-line comments, also known as block comments, allow for comments to span multiple lines, but also allow you to place comments inside a line, which is not 
possible with single-line comments. They are created with a slash and an asterisk at the start of the comment and an asterisk and a slash at the end.

/*
    This is a block
    comment and it can
    span multiple lines

    So this code won't be executed
    console.log("Hello, World!");
*/
let x /* because no better name */ = 42;

console.log(x); // -> 42
