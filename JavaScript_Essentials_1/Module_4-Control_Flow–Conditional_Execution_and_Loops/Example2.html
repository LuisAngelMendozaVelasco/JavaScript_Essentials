<!-- The if statement - continued -->
<!---------------------------------->

<!--
If there is one line inside the if block of code, we could omit the curly brackets around that block. However, while it may look tempting to do so, itâ€™s always better 
to use curly brackets. That way, the code is cleaner and easier to read, and it also saves us from a very common error that happens when trying to add another 
instruction inside an if block and forgetting to add brackets.

<!-- 
By using data blocks, we can make the constants and variables declared inside them local (not visible to the outside).
