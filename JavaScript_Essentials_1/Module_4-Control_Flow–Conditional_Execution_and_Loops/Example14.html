<!-- The while loop - continued -->
<!-------------------------------->

<!--
The while loop is so versatile that someone persistent enough could replace all other control flow instructions with while loops, even if statements. Of course, 
it would be cumbersome at best. The while loop is one of the loops that we normally use when we don`t know exactly how many times something should be repeated, 
but we do know when to stop. The syntax of the while loop is as follows:
    while(condition) {
        block of code
    }

The expression in parentheses is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. If the condition is evaluated to true, the code in the curly brackets 
will be executed. Then execution jumps back to the beginning of the loop, and the condition is evaluated again. The loop will iterate, and the code will be executed 
as long as the condition is evaluated to true. This means, of course, that with an ill-formed condition, a while loop can turn into an infinite loop, a loop without end. 
Depending on the context, that may be what we want to achieve. Almost all computer games, for example, are basically infinite loops that are repeating: reading input 
from the player, updating the game state, rendering on screen as many times per second as necessary. This is a big simplification, but true nonetheless.

<!-- 
In this example, the decision whether the loop is to end will be made by the user answering the question asked during each iteration of the loop.
The loop will be repeated until the isOver variable is set to true. In the loop, we display the question: "Continue the loop?", which is preceded by the number of 
the iteration (the counter variable). Note that the counter variable is not used in the while condition, as its role is only informative. Clicking on the OK button 
in the confirm dialog will cause the continueLoop variable to be set to true (otherwise it will be set to false). Based on the value from the continueLoop variable, 
we set a new value for the isOver variable. Remember that the variable that is tested in the while condition should be initialized beforehand.

                let continueLoop = confirm(`[${counter}] Continue the loop?`);
                isOver = continueLoop === true ? false : true;
                counter = counter + 1;

<!-- 
The example is correct, but there is a lot of redundant code here, which is not really needed. Exactly the same effect will be achieved by simplifying our code as 
shown below.
    let isOver = false;
    let counter = 1;

    while (!isOver) {
        isOver = !confirm(`[${counter++}] Continue the loop?`);
    }
