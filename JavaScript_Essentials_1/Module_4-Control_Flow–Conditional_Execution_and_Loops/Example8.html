<!-- Conditional operator - continued -->

<!--
The conditional operator returns the values of the second or third operand, but if they are complex expressions, it will calculate them first. We can use this fact 
to place the commands to be executed conditionally as these operands.

Itâ€™s possible to have longer code as operands, but itâ€™s better to use if statements, as it is much clearer what intention the developer had when writing the code.
