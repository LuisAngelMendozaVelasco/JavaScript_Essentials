<!-- Asynchronous callbacks - continued -->

<!--
If we run the JavaScript code on the client side, in the browser, it is always associated with the website. The window in which this page is located is represented in 
the client-side JavaScript by a global window variable. The window object has a method (or its own function) named addEventListener. This function allows us to register 
a certain action to be performed in response to a window-related event. Such an event can be a "click", which is a single mouse click on any place on the page (there is 
a limited set of named events associated with a particular object, to which it can react). The action to be taken is passed to the addEventListener method as a callback 
function.
-->

<!--  
When we execute the sample code, nothing special should happen immediately after it is started. Only when we click anywhere on the page should a message appear on the 
console: "clicked!". Our function is not called until the "click" event occurs, which is absolutely asynchronous. In the meantime, between subsequent clicks, the rest 
of the program could be executed, if we had a whim to write it.

In fact, it is not a very good idea to connect a click response to a window object. Most often, such actions are associated with specific elements of the interface 
(buttons, checkboxes, etc.)
